`aws-eks-ami-reporter` is set up to run on several regions. It can run
on any region. To see a list of supported regions, check out the
[source code on github](https://github.com/briankopp/aws-eks-ami-reporter).
If you would like `aws-eks-ami-reporter` to
monitor a region it doesn't yet monitor, make a pull request to add
the region to the list.
